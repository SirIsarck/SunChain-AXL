# SunChain-AXL
# ☀️ SunChain Nigeria — Cross-Chain DePIN Infrastructure Access

## Overview

**SunChain Nigeria** is a **decentralized infrastructure (DePIN)** project designed to connect **community solar microgrids and IoT devices** through **Axelar’s cross-chain interoperability network**.

Our mission is to make **renewable energy and decentralized technology accessible** to underserved regions across Africa by enabling **transparent data flow, usage payments, and coordination across chains.**

## ⚙️ What We Are Building

SunChain integrates **solar IoT devices**, **on-chain data tracking**, and **cross-chain payments** using Axelar’s **General Message Passing (GMP)**.

This allows:
- Real-time data exchange between devices and dashboards  
- Seamless wallet-based energy payments  
- Transparent impact tracking across different blockchains  

The system is designed to empower communities with energy independence, digital inclusion, and trustless coordination.


## Why Axelar

Axelar provides the **secure interoperability layer** that allows SunChain to transmit:
- **Energy data**
- **IoT metrics**
- **Cross-chain payments**

Using **Axelar GMP**, SunChain bridges **devices, wallets, and dashboards** across connected networks, **reducing friction** and **enabling real-world adoption** at scale.

## Roadmap

### **Q4 2025**
- Launch IoT-enabled solar pilot with Axelar GMP integration  
- Onboard 100+ community users across 3 Nigerian locations  

### **Q1 2026**
- Publish adoption and performance report  
- Deploy improved energy dashboard  
- Prepare for **SunChain Africa Expansion**

 ## Expected Impact

SunChain Nigeria will demonstrate how **Axelar can power real-world DePIN systems** beyond crypto use cases.  
Through our pilot, we aim to:
- Reduce energy inefficiency  
- Enable local education & tech literacy  
- Prove that **cross-chain data and payments** can serve **grassroots communities** sustainably

## Milestone 01 — Pilot Integration & Reporting

**Tasks:**
- Integrate Axelar GMP  
- Deploy 10 IoT solar units
